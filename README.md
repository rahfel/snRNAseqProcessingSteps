# snRNAseqProcessingSteps

# Background

This repository contains analysis code for the publication found (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.440800v1), which applied paired bulk-tissue and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to anterior cingulate cortex samples derived from 28 individuals, including healthy controls and Lewy body disease cases.

Analyses were shared between two groups, thus code herein relates to:

- Processing and analysis of single nuclei RNA-sequencing data

Code used to process and analyse bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing data and to generate plots is available at: https://github.com/RHReynolds/LBD-seq-bulk-analyses.
